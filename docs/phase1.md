Perfect 👍 Let’s merge your original Phase 1 with the catalog + access requirements, but keep it concise, structured, and visual so it can guide you as a roadmap.

⸻

📑 Phase 1: Core Requirements for DataFlex

1. Authentication Service
	•	Django project with custom user model supporting roles (e.g., owner, viewer, admin).
	•	Implement JWT/OAuth2 endpoints: register, login, token refresh, logout.
	•	Unit tests for authentication & role enforcement.

✅ Solves: secure login, identity, and role-based permissions.

⸻

2. Profile Service
	•	Django app for user profiles linked to authentication users.
	•	CRUD APIs for profile details (name, bio, org, skills).
	•	Public visibility toggle (what can be shown in the catalog).
	•	Unit tests for profile endpoints.

✅ Solves: gives each dataset/microservice an identifiable owner.

⸻

3. Data Upload Service
	•	File upload APIs with metadata storage in PostgreSQL.
	•	Support versioning & retrieval of datasets.
	•	Metadata flags:
	•	Private (default): only owner can access.
	•	Public Metadata: name, description, schema visible in catalog.
	•	Unit tests for upload & versioning.

✅ Solves: secure dataset storage with controlled visibility.

⸻

4. Dataset Access Management (extension of upload)
	•	API for requesting access to private datasets.
	•	Owners can approve/reject requests.
	•	Track access requests in DB.

✅ Solves: controlled dataset sharing.

⸻

5. Catalog Service (public showcase)
	•	Public endpoint that lists:
	•	Microservices users have built (title, description, purpose).
	•	Metadata of datasets marked public.
	•	Owner profile (linked via Profile Service).
	•	Option to mark microservice as public.
	•	Links to demo endpoints (read-only).

✅ Solves: lets general public browse & learn from demos.

⸻

6. Demo Endpoint Exposure
	•	Each user-built ETL/transformation can expose a limited public API.
	•	Example: returns sample transformed data without exposing full dataset.

✅ Solves: public gets hands-on demo without access to raw data.

📌 Example User Flow

Story: “Anil publishes a microservice for others to learn”
	1.	Anil logs in → uploads customers.csv.
	2.	Builds an ETL microservice that cleans the data.
	3.	Marks the microservice as public in the catalog.
	4.	Catalog shows: “Customer Cleaning Pipeline (by Anil)” with description & dataset metadata.
	5.	Student browses catalog → sees demo output via API.
	6.	Student clicks Request Access to full dataset.
	7.	Anil gets notified → approves → student now downloads dataset version.

🚀 Phase 1 Deliverables
	•	✅ Authentication, Profile, Data Upload (private + metadata).
	•	✅ Dataset Access Requests.
	•	✅ Public Catalog (metadata + microservice showcase).
	•	✅ Demo endpoints for trying microservices.
	•	✅ Unit tests across all services.

👉 This setup gives you a secure foundation for data + microservices, while also opening the door for community learning and dataset sharing in Phase 2.

Do you want me to also draft example Django app structure (folders/services) for these 5 services so you can scaffold them right away?
