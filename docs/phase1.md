Summary of Steps to Complete Phase 1 (Foundation & End-to-End Infrastructure Setup)
Prepare Development Environment

Install necessary tools: Python 3.x, Docker, Docker Compose.
Choose a dependency management tool (Poetry or Pipenv) and configure it.
Initialize a Git monorepo with the required folder structure.
DataFlex/
├── platform/
├── microservices/
├── shared/
├── infrastructure/
└── docs/
Set up code linting and formatting tools (e.g., Black, Flake8).
Define Git Workflow and Branching

Decide on a branching strategy (e.g., main, dev, feature branches).
Create a GitHub repository and configure GitHub Actions for CI with a minimal workflow.
Create Core Microservices

Authentication Service:
Set up a Django project with a custom user model supporting roles.
Implement JWT/OAuth2 authentication endpoints (register, login, token refresh, logout).
Write unit tests for user management and authentication flows.
Profile Service:
Create a Django app for user profiles linked to authentication users.
Implement CRUD APIs for profile data.
Write unit tests for profile endpoints.
Data Upload Service:
Implement file upload APIs with metadata storage in PostgreSQL.
Add support for versioning and retrieval.
Write unit tests for file upload scenarios.
Containerize Microservices

Write Dockerfiles for each microservice.
Set up a Docker Compose configuration to orchestrate the local multi-container environment.
Verify that containers build, run, and communicate locally.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Setup

Write basic IaC scripts (Terraform/Ansible) to provision local or cloud development resources.
Simplify the setup for local testing (e.g., local PostgreSQL containers).
Document the provisioning steps.
API Gateway Implementation

Set up a simple API Gateway using NGINX or Traefik as a reverse proxy.
Define routing rules to forward requests to corresponding microservices.
Implement basic security (e.g., token validation middleware).
Setup CI/CD Pipeline

Configure GitHub Actions workflows for:
Code linting and testing on push.
Docker image build and local push simulation.
Optional manual deployment scripts for the local environment.
Develop Simple Demo Microservice

Build a “Hello World” microservice as a proof of concept and pipeline test.
Containerize and deploy it locally.
Add service metadata for catalog registration.



Detailed Guide for Each Step
1. Prepare Development Environment
Install Python 3.x, Docker, and Docker Compose on your local machine.
Choose between Poetry or Pipenv for dependency management and configure it in your project.
Initialize a Git monorepo with the following folder structure:
Set up code linting and formatting tools like Black and Flake8. Add their configurations to the project.
2. Define Git Workflow and Branching
Decide on a branching strategy (e.g., main, dev, feature/*).
Create a GitHub repository and push your monorepo.
Set up GitHub Actions with a minimal CI workflow to run linting and tests.
3. Create Core Microservices
Authentication Service:
Use Django to create a project and app.
Extend the default user model to include roles (e.g., admin, user).
Implement endpoints for user registration, login, token refresh, and logout using JWT/OAuth2.
Write unit tests for all authentication flows.
Profile Service:
Create a Django app for managing user profiles.
Link profiles to the authentication service’s user model.
Implement CRUD APIs for profile data.
Write unit tests for profile endpoints.
Data Upload Service:
Create APIs for file uploads, storing metadata in PostgreSQL.
Add support for file versioning and retrieval.
Write unit tests for file upload scenarios.
4. Containerize Microservices
Write Dockerfiles for each microservice, ensuring they include all dependencies.
Create a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the services locally.
Test that all containers build, run, and communicate with each other.
5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Setup
Write basic Terraform or Ansible scripts to provision resources like PostgreSQL containers.
Focus on simplifying the setup for local development.
Document the steps for provisioning and running the infrastructure.
6. API Gateway Implementation
Use NGINX or Traefik to set up an API Gateway.
Define routing rules to forward requests to the appropriate microservices.
Add basic security features, such as token validation middleware.
7. Setup CI/CD Pipeline
Configure GitHub Actions workflows to:
Run linting and unit tests on every push.
Build Docker images and simulate local deployment.
Optionally, add manual deployment scripts for the local environment.
8. Develop Simple Demo Microservice
Create a “Hello World” microservice to test the pipeline and integration.
Containerize the microservice and deploy it locally using Docker Compose.
Add metadata for the service to register it in the catalog.
