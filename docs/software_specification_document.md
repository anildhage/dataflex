Below is the updated Software Specification Document with notes added to clearly defer the design and development of the interactive microservice demos until later phases. This keeps the initial focus on building the foundational backend, infrastructure, and platform core, while setting expectations about the microservice demo feature.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose  
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the requirements, architecture, and development lifecycle for DataFlex—a Netflix-style catalog platform for data solution microservices with a robust, scalable, multi-user backend built on Python Django. It integrates detailed backend multi-user authentication, profile management, and data upload microservices with a phased approach for infrastructure, catalog, and microservice ecosystem expansion.

**Note:** Interactive microservice demos with live data processing and workflow execution are planned for future phases, after foundational backend and platform infrastructure are stabilized.

### 1.2 Product Scope  
DataFlex allows data professionals to browse, run, and interact with curated data transformation microservices via a user-friendly Netflix-like catalog front end. It provides secure user authentication and role-based access control, with backend services designed as containerized microservices deployed across dev, UAT, and production environments.

### 1.3 Intended Audience  
- Solo Developer / Business Analyst (You)  
- Future DevOps and QA teams  
- End users: Data Engineers, Scientists, Technical Managers, Students  

***

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective  
DataFlex is a microservices-based platform leveraging Docker containerization and Kubernetes-ready orchestration for modular, scalable deployment. It breaks backend functionality into services including Authentication, Profile Management, and Data Upload, interacting via REST APIs proxied through an API Gateway. The UI provides a Netflix-style browsing catalog integrated with service metadata.

**Note:** The initial microservice demonstrations will be simple placeholder services (e.g., a "Hello World" microservice) used to test pipelines and integration. Fully interactive demos will be designed and implemented in later phases.

## 4. Phase-Based Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & End-to-End Infrastructure (6 weeks)  
- Initialize monorepo and project structure  
- Define branching, code review, and dependency management (Poetry/Pipenv)  
- Setup Infrastructure as Code provisioning for dev, UAT, prod  
- Implement Authentication microservice (JWT, OAuth2, roles)  
- Profile Management and Data Upload microservices with REST APIs  
- Containerize all microservices; Docker Compose local orchestration setup  
- Build Netflix-style UI catalog skeleton (basic browsing/search)  
- Setup CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployments  
- API Gateway implementation for routing and security  
- **Develop simple “Hello World” microservice demos for testing only**  

### Phase 2: Catalog Platform Development (5 weeks)  
- Enhance service metadata, registration, health monitoring  
- Build UI features for browsing, filtering, detailed service views  
- Integrate user documentation and tutorials  
- **Defer implementation of immersive interactive microservice demos to later phases**  

### Phase 3: Microservice Ecosystem Expansion (6 weeks)  
- Add ETL and batch pipeline microservices  
- Build ML pipeline and data governance tools  
- **Plan and prototype interactive demo workflows**  

### Phase 4: Optimization & Security (4 weeks)  
- Performance tuning, caching, load balancing  
- Security features (MFA, audits, analytics)  
- User feedback, rating system, advanced monitoring  

***

## 5. System Features and Requirements

### 5.1 Core Platform Features  
- Multi-user account registration, authentication, and roles  
- Secure user profile CRUD operations  
- Data upload microservice with file versioning and metadata  
- Netflix-style catalog browsing UI (deferred)  
- Automated CI/CD and monitoring  
- **Interactive demos deferred; only simple demo microservices implemented initially**  

***
## 6. External Interface Requirements

- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation  
- Responsive Web UI interfacing with APIs (planned)  
- Infrastructure interfaces for IaC and monitoring  

***

## 7. Quality Assurance

- Unit and integration tests targeting >80% coverage  
- End-to-end testing of user-critical workflows  
- Performance and security vulnerability scans  
- Code linting and documentation compliance  

***

## 8. Detailed Technical Architecture

### 8.1 Backend Microservices  
- **Authentication Service:** Django-based with JWT, OAuth2, multi-role support following best practices (see the generated image above)[1][2]
- **Profile Service:** User profile management with CRUD APIs and ORM models  
- **Data Upload Service:** Handles secure file uploads, metadata storage, and validation  

### 8.2 Containerization and Deployment  
- Docker images per microservice  
- Docker Compose used for local dev, Kubernetes planned for production  
- CI/CD pipelines automate building, testing, and deploying containers  

### 8.3 API Gateway  
- Centralized request routing and authentication enforcement  
- Coordinates service discovery and load balancing  

***

## 9. Multi-User Backend Architecture and Requirements

### 9.1 User Authentication and Role Management  
- Extend Django auth with custom user models to support roles (admin, regular user)  
- JWT issued on login, validated on every request to microservices  
- Token refresh and logout endpoints implemented  
- Middleware for role-based access control on APIs  

### 9.2 Security Controls  
- Password hashing with salts and modern algorithms  
- HTTPS enforced for all endpoints  
- Audit logging of login attempts, data uploads, and sensitive operations  

### 9.3 Workflow Examples  
- User registers → Auth Service processes and stores securely  
- User logs in → JWT generated and returned  
- User accesses profile → Profile Service validates JWT, fetches profile  
- User uploads file → Data Upload Service stores file, updates metadata
