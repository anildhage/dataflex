Here is a clear, step-by-step To-Do List tailored for building your minimal viable product (MVP) of DataFlex locally, aligned with the detailed specification document. This plan focuses on foundational backend, microservices setup, and basic platform infrastructure with deferred UI and interactive demos for later phases:

***

# DataFlex MVP Local Development To-Do List

## Phase 1: Foundation & End-to-End Infrastructure Setup (Approx. 6 Weeks)

### 1. Prepare Development Environment  
- Install Python 3.x, Docker, Docker Compose on local machine  
- Choose and configure dependency management tool (Poetry or Pipenv)  
- Initialize git monorepo with folder structure (`platform/`, `microservices/`, `shared/`, `infrastructure/`, `docs/`)  
- Setup code linting and formatting (e.g., Black, Flake8)  

### 2. Define Git Workflow and Branching  
- Decide on branching strategy (e.g., main, dev, feature branches)  
- Setup GitHub repository and enable GitHub Actions for CI with minimal workflow config  

### 3. Create Core Microservices  
- Authentication Service:  
  - Setup Django project/app with custom user model supporting roles  
  - Implement JWT/OAuth2 authentication endpoints (register, login, token refresh, logout)  
  - Unit tests for user management and auth flows  

- Profile Service:  
  - Create Django app for user profiles linked to auth users  
  - Implement CRUD APIs for profile data  
  - Unit tests for profile endpoints  

- Data Upload Service:  
  - Implement file upload APIs with metadata storage in PostgreSQL  
  - Support versioning and retrieval  
  - Unit tests including file upload scenarios  

### 4. Containerize Microservices  
- Write Dockerfiles for each microservice  
- Setup Docker Compose configuration to orchestrate local multi-container environment  
- Verify containers build, run, and communicate locally  

### 5. Infrastructure as Code Setup  
- Write basic IaC scripts (Terraform/Ansible) to provision local or cloud dev environment resources  
- Simplify for local testing (e.g., local Postgres containers) initially  
- Document provisioning steps  

### 6. API Gateway Implementation  
- Setup simple API Gateway using NGINX or Traefik as reverse proxy  
- Define routing rules forwarding requests to corresponding microservices  
- Implement basic security (token validation middleware)  

### 7. Setup CI/CD Pipeline  
- Configure GitHub Actions workflows for:  
  - Code linting and testing on push  
  - Docker image build and local push simulation  
  - Optional manual deployment scripts for local environment  

### 8. Develop Simple Demo Microservice  
- Build a “Hello World” microservice as proof of concept and pipeline test  
- Containerize and deploy locally  
- Add service metadata for catalog registration  

***

## Phase 2: Catalog Platform & UI Foundations (Approx. 5 Weeks)

### 9. Build Catalog Service Backend  
- Define service registration API and metadata storage  
- Implement catalog browsing and search API endpoints  

### 10. Basic UI Skeleton (Deferred but scaffolding)  
- Create placeholder UI with browsing and search of microservice cards  
- Use lightweight framework/templates or static pages for MVP  

### 11. Metadata & Health Monitoring  
- Enhance catalog metadata support (categories, tags, versioning)  
- Add health check endpoints for all microservices  

***

## Phase 3: Expansion & Testing (Approx. 6 Weeks)

### 12. Add Data Processing Microservices  
- Start implementing ETL pipeline demo and other data solutions as simple microservices  
- Write integration tests for workflows  

### 13. Security and Performance Improvements  
- Add HTTPS support locally for testing  
- Improve logging, error handling, and security audits  

### 14. Manual & Automated Testing  
- Write end-to-end tests covering user registration, profile management, data upload  
- Load test basic service interactions  

***

## Phase 4: Preparation for Production & Further Features (Approx. 4 Weeks)

### 15. Plan & Prototype Interactive Demos  
- Research and design interactive demo workflows for next iteration  
- Build prototype microservices or notebooks if feasible  

### 16. Optimize CI/CD & Container Orchestration  
- Configure Kubernetes manifests or prepare managed Kubernetes plans  
- Automate deployment to staging environments  

### 17. Security Enhancements  
- MFA implementation planning  
- Backup and disaster recovery simulations

# Additional Recommendations

- Document each step thoroughly in `/docs/` to preserve knowledge  
- Use tickets or a project board to track progress  
- Regularly backup and version control IaC scripts and configs
